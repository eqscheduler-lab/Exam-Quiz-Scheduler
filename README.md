ExamScheduler - Smart Academic Planning Platform
The all-in-one scheduling and academic management system built for modern schools.

ExamScheduler streamlines exam coordination, academic planning, and staff management across your entire institution. Designed for schools that need structure without complexity.

What It Does
Intelligent Scheduling
Plan quizzes and homework across your academic calendar with built-in conflict detection. The system enforces smart limits - no more than one quiz per class per day - so students are never overloaded. A visual weekly grid gives everyone a clear view of what's coming up.

Role-Based Dashboards
Every staff member sees exactly what they need:

Teachers create and manage their own bookings, track their exam schedule, and plan lessons
Lead Teachers review and approve entries within their department
Coordinators access learning summaries and program analytics
Vice Principals & Principals oversee approvals, analytics, and teacher activity across the school
Administrators manage the entire platform - users, subjects, classes, students, and system settings
Academic Planning Hub
A dedicated workspace for weekly lesson planning and learning support coordination:

Learning Summaries - Teachers document upcoming topics and schedule quizzes, with automatic calendar integration when confirmed
Learning Support (SAPET Program) - Schedule support sessions with Teams meeting links, track attendance, and generate reports
Instant Confirmation - Submit entries and they're confirmed immediately, with automatic email notifications
PDF Reports & Exports
Generate professional PDF documents for any schedule view:

Export single-class or multi-class schedules with color-coded formatting
Download weekly learning summary and SAPET reports
Share schedules with parents, staff, or administration in seconds
Certificate System
Create, issue, and verify staff certificates with built-in authenticity verification:

Design custom certificate templates
Bulk-issue certificates to selected staff members
Every certificate includes a QR code linking to a public verification page
Anyone can scan the QR code to instantly verify a certificate's authenticity
Bulk Import
Get your school set up fast with CSV imports for staff, subjects, classes, and students. Download ready-made templates, fill in your data, and upload - the system handles the rest.

Analytics & Insights
Comprehensive dashboards show scheduling patterns, teacher activity, booking trends, and department utilization. Leadership gets the data they need to make informed decisions.

Department Management
Organize staff into departments (Science, Mathematics, English, Arabic, and more) with full admin control. Lead Teachers have department-scoped authority, keeping oversight focused and manageable.
