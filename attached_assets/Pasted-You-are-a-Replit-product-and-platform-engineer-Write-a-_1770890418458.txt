You are a Replit product and platform engineer.

Write a formal Replit-style RFC / feature proposal for adding a QR-verified certificate generation feature to an already existing Replit-hosted web application.

Assume:
- The app already has authentication, a database, and an admin panel
- A staff (or users) table already exists
- This feature is an extension, not a new standalone product

The proposal must be technical, structured, and suitable for internal engineering review.

The feature should include:

1. Admin-managed certificate templates
   - Support HTML/CSS templates (preferred), with optional image or PDF backgrounds
   - Dynamic placeholders such as {{name}}, {{role}}, {{issued_at}}, {{certificate_id}}, {{qr_code}}
   - Template versioning to ensure previously issued certificates remain reproducible

2. Staff-based certificate issuance
   - Certificates are issued by selecting staff records from the existing staff list
   - No manual data duplication; certificates reference immutable staff snapshots
   - Support bulk issuance from the admin panel

3. Certificate generation service
   - Generate globally unique, non-sequential certificate IDs (UUID or cryptographic hash)
   - Render certificates as PDFs
   - Embed a QR code pointing to a public verification URL
   - Store generated artifacts in filesystem or object storage

4. QR-based verification
   - Public verification endpoint at /verify/{certificate_id}
   - Server-side validation against the existing database
   - Clear valid / revoked / expired states
   - Optional human-readable verification page and JSON response

5. Security and integrity requirements
   - No PII embedded in QR codes
   - Unguessable certificate IDs
   - Immutable certificate records with revocation support

6. Integration with existing app architecture
   - Reuse existing authentication, authorization, and admin UI patterns
   - Minimal disruption to current data models
   - Backward-compatible migrations

The RFC must include the following sections:
- Title
- Status
- Motivation
- Goals
- Non-Goals
- Proposed Solution
- Technical Design
- Integration with Existing App
- Data Model (example schemas)
- Security Considerations
- Developer Experience
- Use Cases
- Alternatives Considered
- Open Questions
- Success Metrics
- Conclusion

Tone should be clear, concise, and engineering-focused.
Do not include marketing language.
