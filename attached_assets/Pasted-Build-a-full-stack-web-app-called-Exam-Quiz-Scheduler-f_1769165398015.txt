Build a full-stack web app called “Exam & Quiz Scheduler” for a school to schedule exams/quizzes across the academic year.

TECH STACK (use this unless impossible):
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- DB: SQLite (via Prisma) so it works easily on Replit
- Frontend: React + Vite (or Next.js if easier)
- Auth: JWT + bcrypt
- PDF generation: server-side PDF export (pdfkit or puppeteer). The schedule table must be printable as a PDF.

CORE CONCEPTS & RULES
1) Working days and periods:
- Monday–Thursday: 8 periods/day
- Friday: 4 periods/day
- Each period is 50 minutes.
- The UI should allow picking a day + period OR day + exact start time, but it MUST map to a period index.
  - Admin can configure bell schedule (period start times) in Settings, but provide a sensible default.
- Scheduling must prevent invalid periods (e.g., period 6 on Friday is not allowed).

2) Exam booking limit rule:
- Teachers are NOT allowed to book an exam for the same Class + Section if that Class+Section already has 3 exams on that day.
- When they try, show this message exactly:
  “The maximum number of exams is reached, please choose another day to conduct your exam.”

3) Exam fields:
- Title (required)
- Type: Exam or Quiz (dropdown)
- Subject (select from subjects)
- Day (date)
- Period (1..8 or 1..4 depending on day) and auto-derived time window (50 min)
- Class Program: one of (AET, AMT, ENI, CAI, ASP)
- Section: integer (1,2,3,...)
- CreatedBy teacher
- Status: Scheduled / Cancelled (don’t hard delete; keep history)
- Audit: createdAt, updatedAt

ROLES & PERMISSIONS
Roles:
A) Teacher
- Can book exams/quizzes for their assigned subjects (or allow all subjects initially, but keep structure for assignment)
- Can view schedule
- Can manage ONLY their own exams: create, reschedule, cancel
- Cannot exceed 3-exams-per-day limit per Class+Section

B) Admin
- Full access to everything
- Staff management: add/remove staff, set roles, reset passwords
- Subject management: add/remove subjects with (subjectName, subjectCode)
- Student management: add/remove students with:
  - studentName
  - studentID (unique)
  - classProgram (AET/AMT/ENI/CAI/ASP)
  - section (1,2,3,...)
- Can view schedule as a TABLE and export as PDF for printing
- Can edit or add exams too

C) Principal and Vice Principal
- Overhaul view (read everything)
- They CAN edit or add on the schedule (same power as admin regarding exams, but no staff/subjects/students management unless you want it — default: no staff/subjects/students management)

D) Exam Schedule Coordinator
- Runs the system:
  - full schedule view
  - can add/edit exams
  - can export weekly schedule to PDF
  - can “Publish weekly schedule” (a flag) for teachers/students view
- Can generate “Weekly Schedule PDF” for Monday–Friday of a selected week.
- The coordinator can also export a full schedule by date range.

DATA MODEL (Prisma)
Create these tables:
- User: id, name, email(unique), passwordHash, role(enum: TEACHER, ADMIN, PRINCIPAL, VICE_PRINCIPAL, COORDINATOR), isActive
- Subject: id, subjectName, subjectCode(unique)
- Student: id, studentName, studentID(unique), classProgram(enum), section(int)
- ExamEvent: id, title, type(enum EXAM/QUIZ), date (YYYY-MM-DD), period(int), startTime, endTime, classProgram(enum), section(int), subjectId(FK), createdByUserId(FK), status(enum SCHEDULED/CANCELLED), notes(optional)
- Settings: id (singleton), bellScheduleJson (stores start times per day type), maxExamsPerClassSectionPerDay default=3

VALIDATION LOGIC
On create/reschedule:
- Reject if period exceeds allowed for that weekday (Mon–Thu max 8, Fri max 4).
- Enforce max 3 scheduled items per day for the same classProgram + section. Only count status=SCHEDULED.
- If limit reached, return 400 with the exact message required.

UI REQUIREMENTS
1) Login page
2) Role-based dashboard
3) Booking form (Teacher/Admin/Coordinator/Principal/Vice Principal):
- Title, Type, Subject, Date, Period, Class Program, Section
- On selecting date, show allowed periods based on weekday.
- Show warning before submit if near the limit (e.g., “2/3 used”) but enforce on submit.

4) Schedule table view:
- A grid/table:
  - Days as vertical column (rows)
  - Periods as horizontal columns
  - Each cell shows items scheduled for that day/period (can be multiple; list stacked)
  - Clicking an item opens details modal with actions (if permitted).
- Filters:
  - Week selector (default current week)
  - Filter by classProgram + section
  - Filter by teacher (admin/coordinator only)
  - Filter by subject

5) PDF Export (Admin + Coordinator):
- Export the current filtered weekly schedule.
- PDF must be printer-friendly (A4 portrait or landscape; pick what fits best).
- Include header: School Name (placeholder), Week range, Generated date/time, and legend.
- The table must match the UI grid: days down, periods across.

6) Publish Weekly Schedule (Coordinator):
- Coordinator can mark a week as “Published”.
- Teachers and students (students can be view-only, optional) can view published schedules.
- If you don’t build a student login, at least allow a “Public view link” for a published week with read-only access (no personal data).

EXTRA DETAILS
- Working timezone: Asia/Dubai.
- Use clean UI, responsive layout, and clear role-based menus.
- Seed sample data: admin, coordinator, principal, vice principal, 2 teachers, 10 students, 5 subjects.
- Provide README with:
  - How to run
  - Default logins
  - How to export PDF
  - Where the “max 3 exams/day” rule is enforced

DELIVERABLES
- Full working app in Replit
- Database migrations
- Seed script
- API documentation (brief)
- Ensure no crashes if DB is empty

Start by scaffolding the project, then implement DB schema, auth, role middleware, CRUD endpoints, UI screens, and PDF export.
